This repository for Group Project #3. My team members and I decided to devote thios project to a convenience application called the Garage Sale Guru. It's purpose is to makeit mpre convenient for bargainhunters to frequent garage/yard sales without as much hassle. 

## Project Team
- Wynston Saamoi (Front End: React, graphics, HTML, CSS)

We collaborated on this project, splitting the overhead of building out this application to allow garage sale shoppers and those that throw gbarage sales to use our application for a variety of features, such as:
- Inventory and price loading to a database
- Receipt generation
- Online payments
- Inventory downloading to devices
- Mapping to the closest registered garage sales
- Generating QR codes/Barcodes for inventory data transfer
